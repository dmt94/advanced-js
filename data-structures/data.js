Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

Always learn fundamentals! 

Data Structures 
- collection of values
- each values are different in what it can do and what it is used for
- each data structure is good and specialized for its own thing

- each container is useful for its own thing

Data structures
1. how to build one
2. how to use it
  > data structures are tools and most of the time,
  they are prebuilt for us -- how to use one over the other?

Goal:
- understand data structures

How Computers Store Data 
- CPU
  > computer storage 
  > needs access to RAM and storage, 
  but can access to RAM a lot faster
  

- RAM (random access memory)
  >  form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, 
  typically used to store working data and machine code.
  > massive storage area (like data structure)
  > have shelves that are numbered (addresses)
    - each shelf holds 8 bits 
    - bit = tiny electrical switch (byte = one) 1 or 0
    - CPU asks RAM what is in shelf xyz?
      - memory controller has connections to all of the shelves
      - random access memory = access fast, access bits random fast
      - closer info is to CPU = less time
      - shelves closer to each other = less time
      - has a small storage that stores recent memory = cache
    
- Storage
  > persistent storage is slow
  > saving application to computer => saves to storage

Data Structure 
- way for us to store information
- var a = 1
- we represent integers in 32 bits (or 64 bit)
