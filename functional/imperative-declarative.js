/*
imperative code
- tells machine what to do and how to do it
- computer is better for this type of instruction
  - step by step

declarative code
- tells machine what to do and what SHOULD happen
- doesnt tell "how" to do it
- >>> higher level language 
- functional programming allows us to be more declarative
- ends up compiling down by somthing imperative (like machine code)

//more imperative 
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

//more declarative : logs item
[4,4,4].forEach(item => console.log(item));




//jQuery = tells website exactly what to do, more imperative
