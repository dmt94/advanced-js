/* 
So JavaScript classes are constructor functions with a prototype property. 
That is how they work, and until 2015, 
that was how you had to write them. 
These days, we have a less awkward notation.

/* 
Like function, class can be used both in statements 
and in expressions. 
When used as an expression, 
it doesnâ€™t define a binding but just 
produces the constructor as a value.
